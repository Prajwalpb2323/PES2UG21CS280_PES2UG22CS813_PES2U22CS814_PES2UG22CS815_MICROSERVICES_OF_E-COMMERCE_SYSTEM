E-Commerce Microservices
Welcome to our E-Commerce Microservices project repository! This project aims to provide a scalable and resilient architecture for an e-commerce system using microservices. We leverage Docker for containerization, Kubernetes for orchestration, and Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment.


Introduction
In the modern world of e-commerce, scalability, reliability, and agility are key factors for success. This project addresses these requirements by implementing an architecture based on microservices. Each microservice focuses on a specific aspect of the e-commerce system, allowing for independent development, deployment, and scaling.

Features
Microservices Architecture: Decompose the e-commerce system into smaller, manageable services.
Containerization with Docker: Utilize Docker to package each microservice and its dependencies into a container.
Orchestration with Kubernetes: Deploy and manage containers at scale with Kubernetes for increased flexibility and reliability.
Continuous Integration and Deployment with Jenkins: Automate the build, test, and deployment process with Jenkins for rapid delivery and feedback.
